## What is Terminal Coloring

It is a quick instruction to personalize your terminal.

## Instructions

Download and save the following files:

```bash
git-completion.bash
git-prompt.sh
.bashrc
```

Then copy them to the home directory: ```~/```

### Windows & mac
If you already have a file in your home directory named .bash_profile, then copy the content from bashrc and paste it at the bottom of .bash_profile. Otherwise, move bashrc to your home directory and rename it to .bash_profile.

### Linux
If you already have a file in your home directory named .bashrc, then copy the content from bashrc and paste it at the bottom of .bashrc. Otherwise, move bashrc to your home directory.
